Name:       X1RACE
Position:   392
Length:     2
Label:      X1 Student's race/ethnicity-composite

Description:
X1RACE characterizes the sample member's race/ethnicity by summarizing the following six dichotomous race/ethnicity composites: X1HISPANIC, X1WHITE, X1BLACK, X1ASIAN, X1PACISLE, and X1AMINDIAN. The dichotomous race/ethnicity composites are based on data from the student questionnaire, if available; if not available from the student questionnaire, they are based on, in order of preference, data from the school-provided sampling roster or data from the parent questionnaire. X1RACE is derived from the six dichotomous race/ethnicity variables listed above (though the imputed values of X1WHITE, X1BLACK, X1ASIAN, X1PACISLE, and X1AMINDIAN are not stored on the data file). If  any of these input variables are imputed, then the imputation flag for X1RACE (X1RACE _IM) is set to 1.

Label:      X1 Mathematics theta score

Description:
The math theta score represents the student's ability level on a continuous scale.   The theta score provides a norm-referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of achievement relative to the population (fall 2009 9th graders) as a whole. It provides information on status compared to peers (as distinguished from the IRT-estimated scale score which represents status with respect to achievement on a particular criterion set of test items).  When the score is not available, X1TXMTH1-5 are created as the multiple imputation values for X1TXMTH.  X1TXMTH is the mean of X1TXMTH1-5.  The  standard error of measurement for the theta score is X1TXMSEM. The standardized form of the mathematics theta score is X1TXMTSCOR. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math theta score.

Label:      X1 Mathematics standard error of measurement for raw theta score

Description:
The standard error of measurement (SEM) for the theta score indicates the precision in the ability estimate. It is calculated from the sum of item information functions for each item answered by each student. Unlike the classical standard error of measurement, which is a constant, the IRT standard error varies across the scale-score continuum. It is typically smaller for students whose theta score falls toward the center of the distribution because more students answered the items with average difficulty. However, students whose theta scores fall at the extremes of the distribution tend to have a higher SEM because their scores are based on items answered by fewer students overall.  When the score is not available, X1TXMSEM1-5 are created as the multiple imputation values for X1TXMSEM.  X1TXMSEM is he mean of X1TXMSEM1-5. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math theta SEM.

Label:      X1 Mathematics IRT-estimated number right score (of 72 base year items)

Description:
The math IRT-estimated scale score is a criterion-referenced measure of achievement. The criterion is the set of skills defined by the HSLS:09 framework and represented by the 72 items in the HSLS:09 math item pool. The estimated scale score for math is an estimate of the number of items students would have answered correctly had they responded to all 72 items in the item pool. The ability estimates and item parameters derived from the IRT calibration can be used to calculate each student's probability of a correct answer for each of the items in the pool. These probabilities are summed to produce the IRT-estimated number-correct scale score. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math scale score score.

The standardized T score is a transformation of the IRT theta (ability) estimate, rescaled to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. An advantage of the standardized score over the raw theta score is that it facilitates comparisons in standard deviation units. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math T score.

Description:
The math quintile score is a norm-referenced measure of achievement. The quintile score divides the weighted (population estimate) achievement distributions into five equal groups, based on math score (X1TXMTSCOR). Quintile 1 corresponds to the lowest-achieving one-fifth of the population, quintile 5 the highest. To determine the quintile cut-points, the weighted distribution of the standardized scores was divided at the 20th, 40th, 60th, and 80th percentiles. Cut points were matched to unrounded standardized scores. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math quintile score.

Description:
The math proficiency probability scores are criterion-referenced and are based on clusters of items that mark five levels on the mathematics scale developed in HSLS:09. The levels are hierarchical in the sense that mastery of a higher level typically implies proficiency at the lower levels. The HSLS:09 proficiency probabilities were computed using IRT-estimated item parameters. Each proficiency probability represents the probability that a student would pass a given proficiency level. Clusters of four items were identified that marked mathematics level 1: algebraic expressions. Students able to answer questions like these have an understanding of algebraic basics including evaluating simple algebraic expressions and translating between verbal and symbolic representations of expressions. See Chapter 2 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328) for more information on the derivation of the math proficiency probability score.

Label:      X1 Parent 1: current/most recent occupation: 2-digit ONET code

Description:
X1PAR1OCC2 stores the 2-digit Occupational Information Network (O*NET) code of "parent #1's" current (or most recent) job; "parent #1" is the parent to whom all "parent #1" variables (e.g., X1P1RELATION, X1PAR1EMP, P1YRBORN1, P1USYR1, etc.) refer.  Use X1PAR1EMP to distinguish whether the code stored in X1PAR1OCC2 refers to a current or most recent job.  X1PAR1OCC2 is taken from the base year parent questionnaire; if missing or "uncodeable" from the base year parent questionnaire, X1PAR1OCC2 is statistically imputed for cases with a completed parent interview (imputed values in X1PAR1OCC2 can be identified using X1PAR1OCC_IM).  See also https://www.onetcenter.org/ for further information on the O*NET taxonomy.

Description:
This variable indicates: (1) whether there are one or two parents in sample member's home, (2) the relationship of those parent(s) to the sample member, and (3) if there are two parents in the home, the relationship of those parents to each other.  This variable was derived from two composite variables (X1P1RELATION and X1P2RELATION) which contain imputed values, as well as one parent questionnaire variable (P1HHTIME) which was imputed, when missing, for the purposes of constructing X1PARPATTERN (though the imputed values of P1HHTIME are not delivered).

Note: Combined "Bio/adoptive mother and non-partner guardian" with "Bio/adoptive mother and non-bio/adoptive partner" into "Bio/adoptive mother and other guardian" and combined "Bio/adoptive father and non-partner guardian" with "Bio/adoptive father and non-bio/adoptive partner" into "Bio/adoptive father and other guardian" on the public use file.

Label:      X1 Mother/female guardian's employment status

Description:
For sample members who have a biological, adoptive, or step mother living in their household, X1MOMEMP indicates the employment status of that biological, adoptive, or step mother.  X1MOMEMP is derived from four composite variables (X1P1RELATION, X1P2RELATION, X1PAR1EMP, and X1PAR2EMP) which contain imputed values; if any of these four input variables are imputed and the mother's employment could not be determined from unimputed data, then the imputation flag for X1MOMEMP (X1MOMEMP_IM) is set to 1.

Label:      X1 Mother/female guardian's current/most recent occupation: 2-digit ONET code

Description:
For sample members who have a biological, adoptive, or step mother living in their household, X1MOMOCC2 stores the 2-digit Occupational Information Network (O*NET) code for that biological, adoptive, or step mother's current (or most recent) job.  Use X1MOMEMP to distinguish whether the code stored in X1MOMOCC2 refers to a current job or most recent job.  X1MOMOCC2 is derived from four composite variables (X1P1RELATION, X1P2RELATION, X1PAR1OCC2, and X1PAR2OCC2) which contain imputed values; if any of these four input variables are imputed and the mother's occupation could not be determined from unimputed data, then the imputation flag for mother's occupation (X1MOMOCC_IM) is set to 1.  See also https://www.onetcenter.org/ for further information on the O*NET taxonomy.

Name:       X1HHNUMBER
Position:   577
Length:     2
Label:      X1 Number of 2009 household members

Description:
Indicates the total number of people living in the sample member's household, as reported by the parent questionnaire respondent.  X1HHNUMBER is the sum of P1HHLT18 (number of household members less than 18 years of age) and P1HHGE18 (number of household members 18 years or older), both of which are based on questions from the base year parent questionnaire which accepted only single-digit responses (i.e. the two input variables for this composite are essentially top-coded at 9).  If either of these two input variables stores a value of 9, X1HHNUMBER will store a value (98 or 99) indicating that one or both of the input variables was top-coded; X1HHNUMBER values of 98 and 99 therefore refer to households where the exact number of household members can not be determined, but can be safely assumed to be 9 or greater.  The two input variables for this composite were imputed for the purposes of constructing X1HHNUMBER (though the imputed values of P1HHLT18 and P1HHGE18 are not delivered).  If either of these two inputs is imputed, then the imputation flag for X1HHNUMBER (X1HHNUMB_IM) is set to 1.


Households with more than 11 members or with inputs (p2hhlt18 and p2hhge18) top coded at 9 are recoded as "11+ Household members" on the public use file.

Label:      X1 Socio-economic status composite

Description:
This composite variable is used to measure a construct for socioeconomic status. X1SES is calculated using parent/guardians' education (X1PAR1EDU and X1PAR2EDU), occupation (X1PAR1OCC2 and X1PAR2OCC2), and family income (X1FAMINCOME). For cases with nonresponding parent/guardians, 5 imputed values are generated (X1SES1-X1SES5), X1SES is computed as the average of the 5 imputed values, and the imputation flag is set as X1SES_IM=1 (values for parent/guardian education, occupation, and income are set to -8). When education, occupation, or family income are imputed using other information provided by the responding parent/guardian, X1SES is constructed from the combination of actual and imputed parent/guardian values. For these cases, the values of X1SES1-X1SES5 are equivalent to X1SES and X1SES_IM=2. Otherwise, the responding parent/guardian provided responses for all input variables so that the values of X1SES1-X1SES5 are again equivalent to X1SES and X1SES_IM=0. For more information on this variable, please refer to section 7.3.2.2 and appendix k of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328).

Label:      X1 Scale of student's interest in fall 2009 math course

Description:
This variable is a scale of the sample member's interest in their base-year math course; higher values represent greater interest in their base-year math course.  Variable was created through principal components factor analysis (weighted by W1STUDENT) and standardized to a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1. The inputs to this scale were S1MENJOYING, S1MWASTE, S1MBORING, S1FAVSUBJ, S1LEASTSUBJ, and S1MENJOYS. Only respondents who provided a full set of responses were assigned a scale value. If the student indicated that he or she was not taking a fall math class, this variable is set to -7.  The coefficient of reliability (alpha) for the scale is .65 or higher. For more information on this scale score, please see chapter 5 of the Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328).

Label:      X1 Student to math teacher link descriptor

Description:
X1TMLINK characterizes the linkage between the student and the base-year math teacher associated with that student on the HSLS data file. The values assigned are a product of comparison between student-provided teacher information and the teacher information provided by the school. Values of 1 through 3 represent cases where the math teacher associated with the student is a respondent, with values of 1 representing the ‘strongest' links (due to consistency between student- and school-provided information), and values of 2, and 3 representing links considered less strong due to inconsistent and/or missing information. Values of 8 are assigned in cases where a link could not be established between the student and a teacher because the teacher did not respond to the questionnaire. Values of 9 are assigned in cases where the student's school indicates the student is not enrolled in a math class and the student either indicates they are not enrolled in a math class or their class information is missing. For more information about teacher linkages, please refer to chapter 5 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328).

Label:      X1 Student to science teacher link descriptor

Description:
X1TSLINK characterizes the linkage between the student and the base-year science teacher associated with that student on the HSLS data file. The values assigned are a product of comparison between student-provided teacher information and the teacher information provided by the school. Values of 1 through 3 represent cases where the science teacher associated with the student is a respondent, with values of 1 representing the ‘strongest' links (due to consistency between student- and school-provided information), and values of 2, and 3 representing links considered less strong due to inconsistent and/or missing information. Values of 8 are assigned in cases where a link could not be established between the student and a teacher because the teacher did not respond to the questionnaire. Values of 9 are assigned in cases where the student's school indicates the student is not enrolled in a science class and the student either indicates they are not enrolled in a science class or their class information is missing. For more information about teacher linkages, please refer to chapter 5 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328).

Label:      X1 Student to science teacher course-level link descriptor

Description:
X1TSCRSLINK characterizes the linkage between the student and the course-level data provided by the science teacher associated with that student on the HSLS data file. Values of 1 are assigned in cases where X1TSLINK=1 and the student confirmed enrollment in the associated course and could be linked using school records data to a course reported in the teacher questionnaire.  Values of 2 are assigned in cases where X1TSLINK=1 or 3 and the student did not confirm enrollment in the associated course but could be linked using school records data to a course reported in the teacher questionnaire.  Values of 8 are assigned where X1TSLINK=1, 2, 3, or 8 and either the teacher did not provide any course-level information for the school-specified course associated with the given student or the teacher was a nonrespondent. Values of 9 are assigned where X1TSLINK=9. For more information about teacher course linkages, please refer to chapter 5 of the HSLS:09 Base-Year Data File Documentation (NCES 2011-328).
